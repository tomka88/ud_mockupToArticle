Your response goes here!

- the basics of html is easy to pick up 
- using sublime efficiently takes time, shortcuts are very handy e.g.: ctrl + shift + w wraps text in tags. I havenâ€™t used Atom before but it looks very cool too 
- google is my friend :)
- I was already familiar we learned so far so finishing the project went pretty fast
